# MIDI Monkey MidiKeyMap Config v2.0.
# To create your MIDI Key Mapping, you need to assign each MIDI key to a corresponding keyboard key.
# Each mapping can include a modifier key (such as Shift or Control) followed by the alphanumeric keyboard key.
# If you do not want to use a modifier key, simply omit it and use only the alphanumeric key.
# The configuration follows this structure:
#   1. MIDI Key: The MIDI note you want to map (0 to 127)
#   2. Modifier Key (Optional): The modifier key, if any (e.g., LeftShift, RightShift)
#   3. Alphanumeric Keyboard Key: The key on the keyboard (e.g., Q, W, Number1, Number0)
#   4. ApplicationName: The process name (without .exe) that this mapping is for
