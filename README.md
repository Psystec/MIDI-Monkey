## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirements

- Windows OS
- .NET 8.0 Runtime ([Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0))
- Any game or application that accepts keyboard input

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/YourUsername/MIDI-Monkey/releases)
2. Launch MIDI Monkey.

## üìù How to Use

### Basic Setup

1. **Select a MIDI KeyMap Profile**:
   - Choose from the built-in profiles or create your own
   - Each profile maps MIDI notes to specific keyboard keys

2. **Load MIDI Files**:
   - Click "Select MIDI Folder" to load your MIDI files
   - Select a MIDI file from the list

3. **Start Playback**:
   - Make sure your game/application is running
   - Click "Play Song" or press F5 to start playback
   - Press F6 to stop playback at any time

### Using a MIDI Keyboard

1. Connect your MIDI keyboard or device to your computer
2. Select it from the "MIDI Device" dropdown
3. Click "Use MIDI Device"
4. Play notes on your MIDI keyboard - they will be automatically translated to keypresses

### Creating Custom KeyMaps

1. Navigate to the 'MIDIKeyMaps' folder in your installation directory
2. Create a new JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "ApplicationName": "YOUR_GAME_PROCESS_NAME",
  "KeyMappings": {
    "60": [ "", "VK_Q" ],
    "61": [ "", "VK_2" ],
    "62": [ "", "VK_W" ],
    "63": [ "", "VK_3" ],
    "64": [ "", "VK_E" ]
  }
}
```

3. The numbers represent MIDI note values (60 = middle C)
4. The strings represent keyboard keys to press
5. You can add modifiers by including them as the first key:

```json
"48": [ "LCONTROL", "VK_Q" ]
```

### Advanced Settings

- **Tempo**: Adjust playback speed (faster or slower)
- **Modifier Delay**: Add a delay between pressing modifier keys and the main key
- **Repeat Song**: Enable to loop the song continuously
- **Always on Top**: Keep MIDI Monkey visible over your game

## üìã Supported Games & Applications

MIDI Monkey works with any game or application that accepts keyboard input, including:

- Once Human
- Final Fantasy XIV
- Rust
- Starfield

- Black Desert Online

## üîß Troubleshooting

**Game not recognizing key presses?**

- Verify the process name in your KeyMap matches your game exactly
- Try running MIDI Monkey as administrator

**MIDI device not working?**
